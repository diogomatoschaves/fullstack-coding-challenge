# Unbabel Fullstack Coding Challenge

This project is a fork of the Unbabel Fullstack Coding Challenge (https://github.com/Unbabel/fullstack-coding-challenge),
and is an implementation of all the functionality as per the challenge's requirements.

The app consists of a user interface for translating Content in english to Spanish, backed by a backend that handles
the requests the user sends. The frontend was implemented with the React Javascript framework, whereas the backend was
built on top of the Flask Framework.


## Prerequisites

You'll need to have installed in your machine the following:

- python 3
- npm
- redis (brew install redis)


## Installation & Usage

This repo is split between the server api and the frontend. In order to run the app you'll need to install the projects
dependencies on each subdirectory (backend and frontend). You can check out the README for each sub directory for more
information on installation.
