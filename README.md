# Unbabel Fullstack Coding Challenge

This project is a fork of the Unbabel Fullstack Coding Challenge (https://github.com/Unbabel/fullstack-coding-challenge),
and is an implementation of all the functionality as per the challenge's requirements.

The app consists of a user interface for translating Content in english to Spanish. The app has a frontend user interface,
with a backend that handles the requests the client sends. The frontend was implemented with
the React Javascript framework, whereas the backend was built on top of the Flask Framework.


## Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following packages installed in your machine:

- python 3 (with pipenv)
- redis (brew install redis)
- postgreSQL
- npm


## Installation & Usage

This repo is split between the back and the frontend. In order to run the app you'll need to install the projects
dependencies on each subdirectory (backend and frontend). You can check out the README for each sub directory for more
information how to install and run the application.
